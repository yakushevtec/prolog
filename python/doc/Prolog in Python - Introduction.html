<p>Someone once made the remark that there were only two kinds of 
programming languages, Lisp and all the others. At that time the primary
 languages like Fortran were much more machine centric than those of 
today. That is, the way you programmed was, although more efficient, not
 too different than how you would program in machine language. Lisp with
 dynamic data, automatic garbage collection, and the ability for a lisp 
program to easily create and run more lisp code was very much an 
exception.</p>
<p>However over time, modern languages, like Python, came to support the
 kind of features found in Lisp. Today, the above remark might be 
changed to "Prolog and all the others".</p>
<p>The motivation for this project has been to deepen my own 
understanding of Prolog and hopefully share some of what I learn with 
others. The program is too slow to be used for any real world 
programming. But the ability to play with the source, add new features, 
maybe sprinkle print statements or use the trace feature when something 
is obscure is invaluable. Lots of real Prolog interpretors can be found 
on the internet. Or if someone is interested, porting this code to C++ 
would increase the speed considerably.</p>

<p>I developed this code from scratch several years ago through trial 
and error (lots and lots of error) and did not look at any other 
implementation. Frankly, I wanted to solve the puzzle instead of looking
 up the answer. But after thrashing around for awhile I found I did need
 a hint. That hint led to the use of the goal stack processed from a 
loop (function "search"). Once I started doing that things started to 
fall into place.</p>
</div>
<p>The program is built in three versions, each expanding on its 
predecessor. From the start I assumed that a single complete program 
would be too much to make work at one go. And also too much to explain.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/prolog/prolog1.html" class="reference external">Version one</a> contains the essential goal searching logic and storage of rules. Terms remain very simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/prolog/prolog2.html" class="reference external">Version two</a> allows nested terms which make lists possible and also supports the square bracket syntax for lists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/prolog/prolog3.html" class="reference external">Version three</a> provides some arithmetic and comparison operations as well as the "cut" and "fail" operators.</p>
<h2 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources</h2>
<p>Lots of information and real Prolog interpreters (and even compilers)
 are available on the internet. A google search for "Prolog" will get 
you started.</p>
<p>I also found the Clocksin's book "Clause and Effect" a delightful 
read. It is short, only about 150 pages, but contains a good 
introduction to Prolog and some surprising case studies. It is not aimed
 at the beginning programmer, but if you find these pages digestable 
then his book may be right for you as well. The book was a strong 
motivator for me to start this website and also tweaked my interest in 
Logic circuits and the small compiler. Clocksin presents Prolog versions
 of similar programs.</p>
