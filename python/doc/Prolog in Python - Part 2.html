<p>This second version of our Prolog interpretor implements only a 
single new feature. But that feature will enable the use of trees and 
lists and is necessary for more interesting programs.</p>
<p>The feature is simply this. In addition to constants and variables, 
arguments in a term may be other terms. This complicates parsing and 
unification, because both will now need to be recursive, but leaves 
other parts of the program pretty much intact.</p>
</div>
<p>In this chapter, we'll look at compound terms (terms that contain other terms) only in regard to building Prolog lists.</p>
<h2 id="building-lists-with-compound-terms">Building lists with compound terms</h2>
<p>Prolog does not support lists directly but builds them as a set of 
nested terms The predicate "." is used to bind the elements of the list 
together. The term ".(a,b)" may be represented as a mini tree</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>.__ b
|
a</code></pre>
<p>and .(a, .(b, .(c, .()))) becomes</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>.__.__.__nil
|  |  |
a  b  c</code></pre>
<p>The first tree may also be represented in Prolog with the syntax 
"[a|b]" and the second, which is a proper list may be represented by the
 familiar "[a,b,c]". The term ".()" is the empty list represented by 
"[]". With the square bracket syntax, Prolog lists look just like Python
 lists. Prolog lists may contain constants, variables, and of course 
other lists.</p>
<p>Compound terms, and therefore lists, unify in the same way that we 
are already familiar. That is, the predicates must match, they must have
 the same number of arguments, and each argument must unify with the 
corresponding one in the other term. But since arguments themselves may 
be terms the process must be done recursively. Here are some examples. 
assume all variables in the second term are unbound.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>Unification ...
[a,b,c]  with X        binds X to the [a,b,c]
[a,b,c]  with [X,b,c]  binds X to a
[a,b,c]  with [X|Y]    binds X to a, Y to [b,c]</code></pre>
<p>It is important to remember that internally in the program lists are 
nested terms with the "." predicate, but that they are translated to and
 from the square bracket notation for input and display. The pipe 
character "|" effectively splits a list into its first element and the 
remaining elements.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-parser-for-terms">A better parser for terms</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/prolog/prolog2.py" class="reference external">Click here to access the Python code for prolog2.py.</a> You may find it convenient to save it into a file and access it with a text editor.</p>
<p>In the first version of our Prolog interpreter we used the split 
function in the string module to break a term like "mother(mary,bill)" 
first into a predicate "mother" and arguments "mary,bill" (by splitting 
on the "(" character), and later splitting the arguments apart (on the 
commas). Terms in a rule are also separated by commas but we got around 
that by using re.sub to turn just those commas into semicolons, and then
 splitting the terms apart.</p>
<p>Alas, this approach just won't work anymore. If we have nested list 
like "[a,[b,c,d],e]", we want to extract three elements, "a", "[b,c,d]",
 and "e". Not "a","[b","c","d]","e".</p>
<p>To accommodate this prolog2.py contains its own split function that 
splits only when a separator is at a zero nesting level. As a string is 
scanned, the nesting level is increased by one whenever a "(", or "[" is
 encountered, and decreased by one whenever a ")" or "]" is encountered.
 In addition an optional "All" parameter, when 0, lets us split off just
 the first predicate in the term.</p>
<p>As in Prolog1.py terms are objects and compiled from text. There is 
also a mode where a predicate and argument list may be compiled into a 
term. (line 35). This is used by the eval function. With text however, 
either a list (line 39) or a standard term may be compiled. But now that
 arguments are also terms, Term initialization is recursive. The Python 
map function builds all the argument terms with a single call. (lines 42
 and 52). Finally a simple constant or variable is a term with no 
arguments, like it was in prolog1.py (line 55).</p>
<p>The Term __repr__ method will determine how terms are displayed when 
printed or passed to the builtin str function. Since lists are really 
nested terms using the "." predicate, they are now translated back to 
the square bracket notation. (line 59). Other terms are output the same 
way they were in prolog1.py.</p>
<p>Let's play with the Term class a bit</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from prolog2 import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Term("bill")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
bill
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.pred
'bill'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.args
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Here we have compiled the simplest possible term, a constant. It 
prints its name and in order to see the insides (pred and args) we need 
to look at the attributes directly.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Term("tasty(food(meat))")
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
tasty(food(meat))
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.args
[food(meat)]
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is a compound term showing the argument of "tasty" as a nested term.</p>
<p>Next we'll construct a list with the "." operator directly.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Term(".(a,.(b,.()))")
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
[a,b]</code></pre>
<p>But of course, it is more natural to create lists from the list syntax itself.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Term("[x,y,[a,b,c],z]")
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
[x,y,[a,b,c],z]</code></pre>
<p>We can also use the "|" operator to prepend 'x' onto the list "[y,z]".</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = Term("[x|[y,z]]")
&gt;&gt;&gt; e
[x,y,z]
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="an-improved-unify-function.">An improved unify function.</h2>
<p>The Rule and Goal classes are the same as in prolog1.py but 
unification is more complex since looking up variables needs to be done 
recursively. The function <em>unify</em> returns one if the source term 
can be unified to the destination term. Variables in each are looked up 
in their own environments and destination variables may be bound to 
constants in the source.</p>
<p>The new function <em>eval</em> is used to "look up" variables. (line 206). <em>eval</em> is recursive so that if a term is evaluated, each argument is evaluated internally. <em>eval</em> then returns a term with all variable references converted to constants or the value <em>None</em> if this is impossible.</p>
<p>The function <em>unify</em> returns true (1) if the source (or parts 
of it) are still variables. Otherwise it returns true if destination can
 be matched to it piece by piece in basically the same manner as in 
prolog1.py.</p>
<p>Notice that all returns from the function <em>unify</em> are channeled through the function <em>sts</em>. This is for tracing purposes and results in nested unifications being indented in a trace. Let's play with this.</p>
<p>First we'll set up an empty destination environment "e" and unify a constant list with a similar list with variables.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import prolog2
&gt;&gt;&gt; e = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; prolog2.unify(Term("[a,b,c]"),{},Term("[A,B,C]"),e)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; e
{'B': b, 'C': c, 'A': a}
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now we'll unify again (just matching values) since e is already set. 
But this time we'll turn on the trace in the module prolog2.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; prolog2.trace = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; prolog2.unify(Term("[a,b,c]"),{},Term("[A,B,C]"),e)
&gt;&gt;&gt; prolog2.unify(Term("[a,b,c]"),{},Term("[A,B,C]"),e)
 Unify [a,b,c] {} to [A,B,C] {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
   Unify a {} to A {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
     Unify a {} to a {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
     Yes All args unify
   Yes Unify to Dest value
   Unify [b,c] {} to [B,C] {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
     Unify b {} to B {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
       Unify b {} to b {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
       Yes All args unify
     Yes Unify to Dest value
     Unify [c] {} to [C] {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
       Unify c {} to C {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
         Unify c {} to c {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
         Yes All args unify
       Yes Unify to Dest value
       Unify [] {} to [] {'A': a, 'C': c, 'B': b}
       Yes All args unify
     Yes All args unify
   Yes All args unify
 Yes All args unify
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="two-examples-with-lists">Two examples with lists</h2>
<p>Finally we'll examine two classic operations with lists, element membership and the appending of lists.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>? member(X,[X|T])
? member(X,[H|T]) :- member(X,T)</code></pre>
<p>Two rules determine membership. If X is the head of a list or if X is
 a member of the tail of the list. In the first case it doesn't matter 
what the tail "T" of the list is. In the second case it doesn't matter 
what the head "H" of the list is.</p>
<p>With these two definitions we can test for membership</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>? member(a,[a,b,c])?
Yes
? member(b,[a,b,c])?
Yes</code></pre>
<p>And finally Prolog can compute "backwards" so to speak to find all 
the members of the list. In this mode we have something similar to the 
Python "for" statement.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>? member(X,[a,b,c])?
{'X': a}
{'X': b}
{'X': c}
?</code></pre>
<p>The rules for append are a bit trickier. It's always wise to remember
 that the rules constrain the solution but don't specify the 
computation. Here are the two rules for append. The first two arguments 
are the input lists and the third argument is the result.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>? append([],L,L)
? append([X|A],B,[X|C]) :- append(A,B,C)</code></pre>
<p>The first rule says that any list "L" appended to the empty list 
results in the same list "L". The second rules says that if C is A 
appended to B, then it's also true if X is prepended to both A and C.</p>
<p>Let's run some tests computing in both directions.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>? append([a,b],[c,d],X)?
{'X': [a,b,c,d]}

? append([a,b],Y,[a,b,c,d])?
{'Y': [c,d]}

? append(X,Y,[a,b,c])?
{'X': [], 'Y': [a,b,c]}
{'X': [a], 'Y': [b,c]}
{'X': [a,b], 'Y': [c]}
{'X': [a,b,c], 'Y': []}
?</code></pre>
<p>In the last example, Prolog gives us all possible ways the list "[a,b,c]" can be constructed. I think this is kind of wild.</p>
