<h2 id="arithmetic-operations">Arithmetic operations</h2>
<div class="intro-txt">
<p>The final version of our Prolog interpreter implements a few of the 
arithmetic operators as well as the "cut" and "fail" terms. Up to now 
we've been unable to do any numerical computation. Actually, this is not
 Prolog's strong point anyway. But some numerical computation is always 
necessary. For example here is a pair of rules to find the length of a 
list.</p>
</div>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>length([],0)
length([H|T],N) :- length(T,Nt), N is Nt+1</code></pre>
<p>This says that the length of an empty list is zero and the length of 
any other list is one greater than the length of its tail (the list less
 its first term).</p>
<p>The interesting term is "N is Nt+1". For one thing it's in infix. 
There is an equivalent form "is(N,+(Nt,1))" which looks more Prolog-like
 (and Lisp-like) but is harder to read. It turns out that it requires 
only a few extra lines of Python to implement the infix form, although 
the operator "is" is renamed (internally only) to "<em>is</em>" since "is" should remain a valid name.</p>
<p>It is necessary to discuss these operations in some detail. Terms in 
Prolog are used as goals within rules and either succeed or fail. During
 unification variables are sometimes set as goals succeed. With "N is 
Nt+1", or better, "is(N,+(Nt,1))", first the inner term must succeed 
before the outer term is tried.</p>
<p>The '+' operator succeeds only if both arguments evaluate to numbers.
 The term then evaluates to the sum of the numbers. Operators like '-', 
'*'. '/' work in exactly the same way. The boolean operators "&lt;", 
"==", etc. also expect numeric arguments but then simply succeed or 
fail. They are only used as the top term in a goal.</p>
<p>The 'is' operator is a combination of both the Python "=" and the 
'==' operators. A variable on the left that is unset is set to the 
computation on the right and the term succeeds. If the left side is 
already set then the term succeeds only if the two sides are equal. 
Although it's not obvious at this point, this lets us do both of the 
following.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>? length([a,b,c],X)?
{'X': 3}
? length([a,b,c],3)?
Yes
?</code></pre>
<h2 id="code-changes-for-arithmetic">Code changes for arithmetic</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/prolog/prolog3.py" class="reference external">Click here to access the Python code for prolog3.py.</a> You may find it convenient to save it into a file and access it with a text editor.</p>
<p>In prolog1.py we used the split function in the string module to 
split terms in a rule and arguments in a term. In prolog2.py we had to 
write our own "split" function in order to correctly handle nested 
terms. We still were only separating on commas or the left parenthesis 
(to pull a predicate from its arguments).</p>
<p>Some of our infix operators are now more than a single character, such as "&lt;=" or "<em>is</em>". A small adaptation using the variable "lsep" (line 18) which stands for "length of separator" handles this.</p>
<p>Some infix operators are only allowed at the top level of a term. A 
new function "splitInfix" (line 35) and called from "Term" init (line 
42) looks for infix operators (the list "infixOps" is far from complete)
 and essentially makes the string "a&lt;=b" equivalent to "&lt;=(a,b)".</p>
<p>Finally we come to the execution of our new operators. Up to now the 
search function took a term from a rule and then searched for matches in
 the database of other rules. These new operators do not initiate a 
search. Instead they are simply evaluated (with possible side effects) 
and if they succeed the rule is continued with the next term. The code 
for this (lines 201 to 216) check for <em>is</em>", "cut", "fail", and generic functions like "&lt;" all of which are found only at the top level of a term.</p>
<p>Other new operators like "+" exist in nested terms and are processed 
by the eval function (line 244). Each of these operators is handled by 
its own function which builds a new term from its arguments.</p>
<h2 id="cut-and-fail">Cut and Fail</h2>
<p>Consider the following piece of Prolog.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>childOf(X,Y) :- parent(Y,X)
parent(chris,jon)
parent(maryann,jon)
childOf(A,B)?
{'B': chris, 'A': jon}
{'B': maryann, 'A': jon}
?</code></pre>
<p>Jon is the child of both parents so Prolog returns two answers. But 
if we want to only find a first answer we can do the following instead.</p>
<pre class="literal-block"><code>childOf(X,Y) :- parent(Y,X),cut
parent(chris,jon)
parent(maryann,jon)
childOf(A,B)?
{'B': chris, 'A': jon}
?</code></pre>
<p>Cut stops alternatives in the search and then succeeds. In prolog3.py
 this is accomplished by simply truncating the queue of alternatives 
(line 220).</p>
<p>Fail is almost the exact opposite. It stops the current rule, leaving
 any alternatives alone. "Cut" and "fail" are sometimes used together to
 declare complete failure of the search.</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-a-queue-instead-of-a-stack">Searching with a Queue, instead of a Stack</h2>
<p>You may or may not have noticed in prolog2.search function that the 
stack of goals became a queue. Other than the change of the variable 
name, the only difference is the "queue.insert(0,c)" instead of 
"stack.append(c)" (line 224 in prolog3.py).</p>
<p>The effect of this change is subtle, but interesting. It changes the 
tree search from depth-first to breadth-first. That, in turn, means that
 multiple goals are processed in parallel rather than one goal being 
completed before another is started. This was also discussed in "Queues,
 Trees and Water Buckets". It opens the door to parallel processing but 
also creates problems, especially with the "cut" operator. Not only does
 the queue need to be emptied but processes running in parallel need to 
stop so as not to add any new goals to the queue afterwards. It's 
basically a synchronization problem. I have read, however, that most 
modern Prologs do use a breadth-first search.</p>
<h2 id="where-from-here">Where from here?</h2>
<p>This is as far as I intend taking the Prolog project, but it can 
certainly be extended further. I'm quite surprised so much could be done
 in about 260 lines of Python, including whitespace.</p>
<p>If you do extend the program I would enjoy hearing from you.</p>
